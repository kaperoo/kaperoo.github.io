                Waters initially served solely as the bassist, but following the departure of singer-songwriter Syd Barrett in 1968, he also became 
                lyricist, co-lead vocalist, and conceptual leader.

                David Jon Gilmour joined Pink Floyd as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of Syd Barrett.
                Initially he was invited to the band by drummer Nick Mason as a cover for Syd Barret, whos erratic behaviour became a burden for band members.

                Nicholas Berkeley Mason, (born 27 January 1944) is an English drummer and founding member of Pink Floyd. 
                He is the only member to feature on every Pink Floyd album, and the only constant member since its formation in 1965. He co-wrote Pink Floyd 
                compositions such as "Echoes", "Time", "Careful With That Axe, Eugene" and "One of These Days". In 2018, he formed a new band, Nick Mason's 
                Saucerful of Secrets, to perform music from Pink Floyd's early years.

                Roger Keith "Syd" Barrett (6 January 1946 – 7 July 2006) was an English singer, songwriter, musician, painter and co-founder of Pink Floyd. 
                Barrett named the group and was their original frontman and primary songwriter, becoming known for his English-accented singing, literary 
                influences, stream-of-consciousness writing style, and whimsical take on psychedelia. As a guitarist, he was influential for his free-form 
                playing and for employing dissonance, distortion, echo, feedback, and other studio effects. Due to his problems with drugs, he was kicked out
                from the band in 1968.
