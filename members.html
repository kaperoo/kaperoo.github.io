                Waters initially served solely as the bassist, but following the departure of singer-songwriter Syd Barrett in 1968, he also became 
                lyricist, co-lead vocalist, and conceptual leader.

                David Jon Gilmour joined Pink Floyd as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of Syd Barrett.
                Initially he was invited to the band by drummer Nick Mason as a cover for Syd Barret, whos erratic behaviour became a burden for band members.

                Roger Keith "Syd" Barrett (6 January 1946 – 7 July 2006) was an English singer, songwriter, musician, painter and co-founder of Pink Floyd. 
                Barrett named the group and was their original frontman and primary songwriter, becoming known for his English-accented singing, literary 
                influences, stream-of-consciousness writing style, and whimsical take on psychedelia. As a guitarist, he was influential for his free-form 
                playing and for employing dissonance, distortion, echo, feedback, and other studio effects. Due to his problems with drugs, he was kicked out
                from the band in 1968.
