        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall">
            The Wall is Pink Floyds eleventh studio album, released on 30 November 1979 by Harvest and Columbia Records. 
            It is a rock opera that explores Pink, a jaded rock star whose eventual self-imposed isolation from society 
            forms a figurative wall. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks, and reaching 
            number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and 
            pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.<br><br>

            Bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In The Flesh tour, modelling the character of 
            Pink after himself and former bandmate Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. 
            Producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band were 
            struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. The Wall is the last album to feature Pink Floyd 
            as a quartet; keyboardist Richard Wright was fired by Waters during production, but stayed on as a salaried 
            musician. Three singles were issued from the album: "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" (the band's only UK 
            and US number-one single), "Run Like Hell", and "Comfortably Numb". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed 
            the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature 
            film, for which Waters wrote the screenplay.

                And the sea may look warm to you, babe<br>

                Of a million tear stained eyes<br>
                Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice<br>
                Appears under your feet<br>
                You slip out of your depth and out of your mind<br>
                With your fear flowing out behind you as you claw the thin ice

                When we grew up and went to school<br>
                There were certain teachers who would hurt the children<br>
                In any way they could<br>
                By pouring their derision upon anything we did<br>
                Exposing every weakness<br>
                However carefully hidden by the kids<br><br>
            
                But in the town, it was well known when they got home at night<br>
                Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them<br>
                Within inches of their lives

                Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old<br>
                Can you feel me?<br>
                Hey you<br>
                Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles<br>
                Can you feel me?<br>
                Hey you<br>
                Don't help them to bury the light<br>
                Don't give in without a fight<br><br>
                
                Hey you<br>
                Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone<br>
                Would you touch me?<br>
                Hey you<br>
                With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out<br>
                Could you touch me?<br>
                Hey you<br>
                Would you help me to carry the stone?<br>
                Open your heart, I'm coming home<br><br>
                
                But it was only fantasy<br>
                The wall was too high, as you can see<br>
                No matter how he tried, he could not break free<br>
                And the worms ate into his brain<br><br>
                
                Hey you<br>
                Out there on the road, always doing what you're told<br>
                Can you help me?<br>
                Hey you<br>
                Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall<br>
                Can you help me?<br>
                Hey you<br>
                Don't tell me there's no hope at all<br>
                Together we stand, divided we fall

            <p>
                I've got a little black book with my poems in<br>
                Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in<br>
                When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in<br>
                I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on<br>
                Got those swollen hand blues<br>
                I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from<br>
                I've got electric light<br>
                And I've got second sight<br>
                I've got amazing powers of observation<br><br>

                All down the front of my favourite satin shirt<br>
                I've got nicotine stains on my fingers<br>
                I've got a silver spoon on a chain<br>
                I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains<br>
                I've got wild staring eyes<br>
                And I've got a strong urge to fly<br>
                But I've got nowhere to fly to<br><br>

                Just nod if you can hear me<br>
                Is there anyone home?<br>
                Come on, now<br>
                I hear you're feeling down<br>
                Well, I can ease your pain<br>
                And get you on your feet again<br>
                Relax<br>
                I'll need some information first<br>
                Just the basic facts<br>
                Can you show me where it hurts?<br><br>
                
                There is no pain, you are receding<br>
                A distant ship, smoke on the horizon<br>
                You are only coming through in waves<br>
                Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
                When I was a child, I had a fever<br>
                My hands felt just like two balloons<br>
                Now I've got that feeling once again<br>
                I can't explain, you would not understand<br>
                This is not how I am<br><br>
                
                I have become comfortably numb<br><br>
                
                I have become comfortably numb<br><br>
                
                Okay<br>
                Just a little pinprick<br>
                There'll be no more<br>
                But you may feel a little sick<br>
                Can you stand up?<br>
                I do believe it's working, good<br>
                That'll keep you going through the show<br>
                Come on, it's time to go<br><br>
                
                There is no pain, you are receding<br>
                A distant ship, smoke on the horizon<br>
                You are only coming through in waves<br>
                Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
                When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse<br>
                Out of the corner of my eye<br>
                I turned to look, but it was gone<br>
                I cannot put my finger on it now<br>
                The child is grown, the dream is gone<br><br>
                
                I have become comfortably numb<br>

                Run, run, run, run<br>
                
                You better make your face up with your favourite disguise<br>
                With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes<br>
                With your empty smile and your hungry heart<br>
                Feel the bile rising from your guilty past<br>
                With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters<br>
                And the hammers batter down your door<br>
                You better run!<br><br>
                
                Run, run, run, run<br>
                Run, run, run, run<br>
                Run, run, run, run<br>
                Run, run, run, run<br><br>
                
                You better run all day and run all night<br>
                And keep your dirty feelings deep inside<br>
                And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight<br>
                You better park the car well out of sight<br>
                'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks<br>
                They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box<br>
                You better run!

            <h1 class="stitle">The Trial</h1>
            <p>
                Good morning, Worm your honour<br>
                The crown will plainly show the prisoner<br>
                Who now stands before you<br>
                Was caught red-handed showing feelings<br>
                Showing feelings of an almost human nature<br>
                This will not do<br>
                Call the schoolmaster!<br><br>
                
                I always said he'd come to no good in the end your honour<br>
                If they'd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape<br>
                But my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists<br>
                Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today<br><br>
                
                Crazy, toys in the attic<br>
                I am crazy, truly gone fishing<br>
                They must have taken my marbles away!<br>
                (Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)<br><br>
                
                You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key<br>
                You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!<br>
                You had to go your own way<br>
                Have you broken any homes up lately?<br>
                "Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone"<br><br>
                
                Babe!<br>
                Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms<br>
                M'lud I never wanted him to get in any trouble<br>
                Why'd he ever have to leave me?<br>
                Worm, your honour, let me take him home<br><br>
                
                Crazy, over the rainbow<br>
                I am crazy, bars in the window<br>
                There must have been a door there in the wall<br>
                When I came in<br>
                (Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)<br><br>
                
                The evidence before the court is incontrovertible<br>
                There's no need for the jury to retire<br>
                In all my years of judging, I have never heard before<br>
                Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law<br>
                The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother<br>
                Fills me with the urge to defecate<br>
                (Go on, Judge, shit on him!)<br>
                Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear<br>
                I sentence you to be exposed before your peers<br>
                Tear down the wall!<br><br>
                
                Tear down the wall! [x13]

            <p>
                All alone, or in twos<br>
                The ones who really love you<br>
                Walk up and down, outside the wall<br>
                Some hand in hand<br>
                And some gathered together in bands<br>
                The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand<br>
                And when they've given you their all<br>
                Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy<br>
                Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall<br>
