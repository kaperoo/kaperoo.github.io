        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_(Pink_Floyd_album)">
            Animals is Pink Floyds tenth studio album, released on 21 January 1977 through Harvest and Columbia Records. 
            It was recorded at the band's Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976, and was produced by the band. 
            The album continues the longform compositions that made up their previous works, 
            including Wish You Were Here (1975). The album received positive reviews from critics and was commercially successful, 
            reaching number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the USA.<br><br>

            Animals is both a progressive rock album and a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s 
            Britain, and was a change from the style of their earlier work. Tension within the band during production culminated 
            in keyboardist Richard Wright being fired two years later. The album's cover shows an inflatable pig floating between 
            two chimneys of Battersea Power Station, conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed 
            by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson. The band released no singles from the record, but promoted it through the 
            In the Flesh tour. Waters' agitation with audiences during this tour inspired their next record, The Wall.

                If you didn't care what happened to me<br> 
                And I didn't care for you<br> 
                We would zigzag our way through the boredom and pain<br> 
                Occasionally glancing up through the rain<br> 
                Wondering which of the buggers to blame<br> 
                And watching for pigs on the wing<br>

            <p>
                You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need<br> 
                You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street<br> 
                You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed<br> 
                And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight<br> 
                You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking<br> 
                And after a while, you can work on points for style<br> 
                Like the club tie, and the firm handshake<br> 
                A certain look in the eye and an easy smile<br> 
                You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to<br> 
                So that when they turn their backs on you<br> 
                You'll get the chance to put the knife in<br><br>
                
                You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder<br> 
                You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder<br> 
                As you get older<br> 
                Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south<br> 
                Hide your head in the sand<br> 
                Just another sad old man<br> 
                All alone and dying of cancer<br><br>
                
                And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown<br> 
                And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone<br> 
                And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around<br> 
                So have a good drown, as you go down all alone<br> 
                Dragged down by the stone<br><br>
                
                Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused<br> 
                Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used<br> 
                Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise<br> 
                If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze<br> 
                Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending<br> 
                That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend<br> 
                And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner<br> 
                Everything's done under the sun<br> 
                But you believe at heart everyone's a killer<br><br>
                
                Who was born in a house full of pain<br> 
                Who was trained not to spit in the fan<br> 
                Who was told what to do by the man<br> 
                Who was broken by trained personnel<br> 
                Who was fitted with collar and chain<br> 
                Who was given a pat on the back<br> 
                Who was breaking away from the pack<br> 
                Who was only a stranger at home<br> 
                Who was ground down in the end<br> 
                Who was found dead on the phone<br> 
                Who was dragged down by the stone<br> 
                Who was dragged down by the stone

                Big man, pig man<br>
                Haha, charade you are<br> 
                Wooh!<br> 
                You well-heeled big wheel<br> 
                Haha, charade you are<br> 
                And when your hand is on your heart<br> 
                You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker<br> 
                With your head down in the pig bin<br> 
                Sayin', "Keep on digging"<br> 
                Pig stain on your fat chin<br> 
                What do you hope to find<br> 
                Down in the pig mine?<br><br> 

                You're nearly a laugh<br> 
                You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry<br><br> 
                
                Bus stop rat bag<br> 
                Haha, charade you are<br>

                Haha, charade you are<br> 
                You radiate cold shafts of broken glass<br> 
                You're nearly a good laugh<br> 
                Almost worth a quick grin<br> 
                You like the feel of steel<br> 
                You're hot stuff with a hatpin<br> 
                And good fun with a handgun<br><br>

                You're nearly a laugh<br> 
                You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry<br><br> 
                
                Hey you, Whitehouse<br> 
                Haha, charade you are<br>
                You house proud town mouse<br> 
                Haha, charade you are<br> 
                You're tryin' to keep our feelings off the street<br> 
                You're nearly a real treat<br> 
                All tight lips and cold feet<br> 
                And do you feel abused?<br> 
                Gotta stem the evil tide<br> 
                And keep it all on the inside<br><br> 

                Mary, you're nearly a treat<br> 
                Mary, you're nearly a treat, but you're really a cry

            <p>
                Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away<br>
                Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air<br> 
                You better watch out<br> 
                There may be dogs about<br> 
                I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen<br> 
                Things are not what they seem<br><br> 
                
                What do you get for pretending the danger's not real<br> 
                Meek and obedient, you follow the leader<br> 
                Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel<br> 
                What a surprise!<br> 
                A look of terminal shock in your eyes<br> 
                Now things are really what they seem<br> 
                No, this is no bad dream<br> 
            </p>
            <p class="spoken">
                Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want<br> 
                He makes me down to lie<br> 
                Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by<br> 
                With bright knives He releaseth my soul<br> 
                He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places<br> 
                He converteth me to lamb cutlets<br> 
                For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger<br> 
                When cometh the day we lowly ones<br> 
                Through quiet reflection, and great dedication<br> 
                Master the art of karate<br> 
                Lo, we shall rise up<br> 
                And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream<br> 
                Wave upon wave of demented avengers<br> 
                March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream<br> 
                Have you heard the news?<br> 
                The dogs are dead!<br> 
                You better stay home<br> 
                And do as you're told<br> 
                Get out of the road if you want to grow old

                And I know that you care for me too<br> 
                So I don't feel alone or the weight of the stone<br>

                And any fool knows a dog needs a home<br> 
                A shelter from pigs on the wing
